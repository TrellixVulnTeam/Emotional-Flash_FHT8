# Emotional-Flash

## Description  
Emotional Flash is a Flashcard game meant for children with Autism to help them recongize emotions. Typically flash card games of this type are limited to a number of cards.  If it was digital the limit is the size of s3.

## Context  
“The picture exchange communication system (PECS) is a form of augmentative and alternative communication produced by Pyramid Educational Consultants, Inc.[1]While the system is commonly used as a communication aid for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it has been used with a wide variety of learners, from preschoolers to adults, who have various communicative, cognitive, and physical impairments, including cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness.[2] PECS has been the subject of much academic research,[3] with currently over 85 PECS-related publications.[2]” -Wikipedia

There are many autism app offerings (as searchable through Autism Speaks) but many come at a steep price that may be financially inaccessible to the residents of San Jose. This project aims to provide a free PECS web app.
